description: "Musings on migrating from WordPress to Eleventy."
---

Recently I made the decision to migrate my WordPress blog to Eleventy. i made this decision for a few reasons - namely, i don't post very often so it made more sense to host for free using CloudFlare Pages or Netlify rather than pay a web hosting provider monthly, and i wanted more control over my site. in the process of migrating, i noticed some other issues. for example, my seo wasn't well-optimized so my articles didn't appear in relevant search results. this was despite having meta descriptions for each article and using an SEO plugin to check each article before posting.

- takeaways
- more convenient
- like that it's minimalistic and more text-focused
  - sometimes blogs can feel too focused on being aesthetically pleasing rather than informative or even just interesting
- the barrier to me for writing a single blog post is lower, especially now that i can just write in markdown like i normally do.
- cloudflare pages has been difficult to work with mainly do to their documentation. but once it's set up it's easy and there's automatic deployment. all you have to do is merge your pull request to main.
