Lately, I’ve been enjoying tinkering a bit more as a software engineer. I’ve started using more open-source applications, building small things that bring me joy, and sharing those things with other people. I talk about building often because there’s something rewarding about taking something that wasn’t meant for you or people like you and making it work _for_ you instead of the other way around. There’s also something equally rewarding about taking that small thing and sharing it with the world, and then seeing people interact with something that you made.

I’ve been wondering recently if there’s value in creating just for creating’s sake, even if what you create is not something that will ever be profitable or monetizable. There’s something powerful about building something for yourself or others that just makes them breathe easier or brings a smile to your face.

I wonder how different the web would be if experiences like that were still at its core.
