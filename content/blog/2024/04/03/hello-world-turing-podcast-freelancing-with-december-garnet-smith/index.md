Recently, I had the pleasure of being a guest on the [Hello Turing World](https://turingschool.libsyn.com/) podcast hosted by [Bailey Diveley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileydiveley/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bcf16vAaYS6yPoBRib55wgw%3D%3D) and [Jeannie Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-marie-evans/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bcf16vAaYS6yPoBRib55wgw%3D%3D) as part of their Career Pathways series, which highlights non-traditional careers for software developers. I had a great time discussing some of the [mindset shifts I needed to make as part of the transition from full-time employee to business owner](https://decembergarnetsmith.com/2024/02/19/adventures-in-freelancing-the-biggest-downside-of-freelancing/), along with ways to stay organized. When I first began to study programming, I didn't know much about other career paths outside of working as a software engineer for a large company, so I'm excited about this new series in particular. Even if you're not interested in running a business or becoming self-employed, I think it's helpful to learn about these skills so that you can take on individual projects as desired or necessary and have multiple streams of income outside of a 9 to 5 job.

If you're interested in learning more about self-employment or freelancing as a software developer, have a listen via [this link](https://turingschool.libsyn.com/freelancing-with-december-garnet-smith) or wherever you get your podcasts.
