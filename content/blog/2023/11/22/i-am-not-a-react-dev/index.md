Typically when I apply to software engineering roles that use React, I receive the same feedback alongside a rejection: "not enough (in depth) React experience."

For context, I have years of experience working with Vue, a similar JavaScript framework, I have a [side project in React](https://loccollective.com) that I've been working on for the past three years, and of course I have knowledge of vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. The main concern seems to be a lack of professional work experience in React specifically, which is not something that can be easily fixed.

I would like to clarify: I am not a React dev.

I am a web engineer (or web developer or front-end engineer or whatever you would like to call it). I work with a variety of technologies, such as Vue, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Gatsby, and any technology that I can use to build a website or query an API. The technology itself isn't my specialty; instead, it's understanding how the web works. It's understanding web performance, accessibility, testing, and the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript that underlie every single JavaScript framework on the market. It's understanding _when_ to use a framework and that they're not appropriate in all cases. It's the ability to learn new technologies and new things (like [building browser extensions](https://decembergarnetsmith.com/code/#extensions)!) in order to do something on the web.

I worry a little about the state of front-end. I'm not sure if my concerns are hyperbolic ("the sky is falling!") or appropriately foreboding.

I worry that it's too easy to spin up a web application using React, Vue, Angular, etc. without having much knowledge about the web. I worry that there's an over-reliance on CSS frameworks like Tailwind that can only emulate some of the functionalities of CSS. I worry that the web may be becoming less and less accessible due to the proliferation of single-page applications. I worry that [accessibility with single-page applications](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-tips-in-single-page-applications/) may be becoming such an afterthought that it's never added at all. I worry that instead of web developers or front-end engineers, we have many people who only understand the inner workings of one specific technology and not the web itself. I worry that we're creating many bloated, over-engineered front-end applications that are slower to load than their vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS counterparts. I worry that engineers feel pressured to work on projects with frameworks in order to add to their resume rather than because the project itself demands it. I worry about the perception that front-end is "easy" and [CSS isn't worth learning](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/tailwind-and-the-femininity-of-css). I wonder if we'll see any ramifications from this five to ten years from now.

That is to say, my skillset is not limited to a specific technology. I'm not a React dev in the same way that I'm not really a Vue developer or a TypeScript developer. Instead, my goal is to take a holistic look at the web and use the best technology for a job, whether that's a JavaScript framework or something else.

To me, the framework itself is the least important part.
