Recently I stumbled upon a LinkedIn post where a new business owner discussed receiving unsolicited feedback about their business. Strangers would criticize their business name, marketing, and other aspects of their business without knowing any specifics.

One thing people seem not to realize is that just like with life in general, business hindsight is always 20/20. You know more today than you did yesterday, so of course you'll realize things you could've/should've/would've done differently.

For example, one thing I've been thinking about has been my business name. I named my business December Design & Development thinking that it might primarily be a software development business and then eventually expand into a web design and development agency. I've had some interest in design work in the past and currently find myself interested in user experience so thought I might want to do more work on the design side of things. But recently I've realized that I'm not as interested in design work - in that case, it would've made more sense to name my business accordingly. It's possible to switch to a doing business as (DBA) name instead but that would require additional paperwork. If I could go back, I would probably give my business a slightly different name. But I can't, so instead all I can do is make peace with the choices that I've made.

If you're a new business owner, please give yourself some grace and understand that you won't do everything perfectly from the beginning. All you can do is focus on learning from your mistakes and doing better in the future.
