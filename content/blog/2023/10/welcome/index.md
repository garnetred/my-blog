Hello reader - welcome to my blog.

I'm a web engineer with an interest in building an accessible and inclusive web for everyone.

In the future, I'll be posting about building on the web, web accessibility, various web technologies, and working in tech. In the meantime, you can check out my [about](https://decembergarnetsmith.com/about/) page or take a look at some of my [code](https://decembergarnetsmith.com/code/). If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](https://decembergarnetsmith.com/contact/).

Happy reading!
