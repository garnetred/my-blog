# about

Welcome to my blog!

My name is December Garnet-Smith, and I’m a software consultant. I focus on building websites and web applications to improve people’s overall experience on the web. I’m interested in web accessibility (especially cognitive accessibility) and inclusivity – for example, questioning whether particular websites are designed with different marginalized groups in mind or if their experiences are more of an afterthought.

The web can be an overwhelming place. It’s easy to be bombarded with notifications, information overload, advertisements, and animations. I enjoy building web applications that allow people to tailor and customize their experience online.

I became an engineer in a roundabout way. While I’ve always had an interest in technology, I majored in gender studies with a minor in Japanese language and culture as an undergrad. A couple years later, I attended a coding bootcamp and subsequently worked at a startup. Currently I work with e-commerce businesses to improve their website's speed and accessibility. You can learn more about my work here.

In my free time, I enjoy learning languages, traveling, and weightlifting.
